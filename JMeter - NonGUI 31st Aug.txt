JDK: java development kit
===========================
There are following component of JDK:

-Javac	 : java compiler which convert java source code to byte code
	 : here source code .java / .jmx and byte code is .class
	
-JVM(JIT): java virtual machine (memory allocation , deallocation, 				 garbage collection)
	 : just in time which is interpreter
	 : JIT converts byte code (.class) into machine language

-JRE	: java runtime environment / is also known as library

Class		: is wrapper of data member/attribute and function/method 
Object		: is an instance of class 
Encapsulation   : is wrapping of data member and function in single/one unit 
Abstraction /Data hiding: to exposre the essential features of class and hide the 			implementaion i.e. abstraction.
Constructor 
Inheritence


Function/Methods
Variable		: is temp. memory where data can be stored
